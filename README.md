Howdy!

My name is Lenix. I am a current student of Mathematics and Computer Science at Emory University's College of Arts and Science.

I am interested in a bunch of different languages, but in my spare time I mostly play with Python. 

I'm currently learning Django.

If you are interested in a summer intern who loves to learn new things and will invest himself until he gets it, contact me!
